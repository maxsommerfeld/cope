Description: Provides functions to  compute and plot Coverage
    Probability Excursion (CoPE) sets
    for real valued functions on a 2-dimensional domain. CoPE sets are obtained
    from repeated noisy observations of the function on the entire domain.
    They are designed to bound the excursion
    set of the target function at a given level from above and below with
    a predefined probability. The target
    function can be a parameter in spatially-indexed linear regression.
